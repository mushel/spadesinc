Where do you keep your projects?
File structure - you start out at x location and you need to navigate to where you want to create your project folder.

When you launch terminal it starts you in macintosh HD > Users > YourName So we need to navigate to where you would like 
to put your project folder. There’s some basic terminal commands that we should discuss.
	ls shows a list of what is in the directory
	mkdir creates a new directory
	cd changes the directory so you can move around the computer
	mv is for moving a file around
	rm deletes 
	
So now we wanna move up to the Applications folder. 
Type in cd .. and hit enter(push enter to execute the commands) to move jump up a folder.
Type in ls it should list 
Applications   
Creative Cloud Files 
Desktop 
Documents 
Downloads
...
type cd Downloads to go up to the location you want to put your project. 
Type in ls again it should list
	Things in your downloads folder  
Let's create the location for the project. Type mkdir frameworkStarter
Now if you open up your downloads folder there should be a new folder with that name.

Here is the npm page that we are gonna snag off github
https://www.npmjs.com/package/materialize-css
 
Git initializing and cloning:
You are located in the frameworkStarter folder time to initialize it.
Type git init 
Now clone the repo by typing git clone https://github.com/mushel/materialize101
There will be a ton of files in your folder now.
cd materialize install npm with npm install
